# EASY — Enabling Accessible Smart-health for You

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **Team Jaadu** for the hackathon organized by Metaversity in collaboration with CITL VIT Bhopal and OSCode.

> **“Healthcare for all — smart, simple, and truly accessible.”**

## 🌐 Project Overview

**EASY** is a hybrid platform that combines the power of a responsive web app with optional IoT integration to simplify and democratize healthcare for all, especially the elderly, chronically ill, and tech-challenged individuals.

This platform provides:
- Real-time vitals tracking (via manual input or IoT sensors)
- Medication and appointment reminders
- Doctor and caregiver connection
- Emergency alert systems

Our goal: **Make healthcare routines easier, safer, and smarter for everyone.**

# Commit Prefix Guide

To maintain a clear and organized commit history, We might follow a set of standardized prefixes in our commit messages. These prefixes help quickly identify the purpose and scope of each change, making collaboration and project tracking easier.

Below is the list of prefixes we use along with their meanings and examples:
To keep out commit history clear and consistent, we use these commit message prefixes:
